**Background**

I worked on several groundwater exploration projects during my undergraduate studies at the Federal University of Technology in Nigeria. Later, for my master's, I studied North American extreme precipitation patterns using complex network theory at Kansas State University. Now, at the University of Connecticut, my Ph.D. research combines my hydrology and computational geosciences knowledge with my passion for water-related issues. My Ph.D. study is focused on integrating different hydrologic techniques, including data-driven and numerical models, to characterize groundwater systems better and sustainably manage water resources.
