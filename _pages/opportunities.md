**I am looking for 1-2 motivated Ph.D. students to join our group at UConn starting in Fall 2024.** 

If you are interested in water, climate and artificial intelligence (AI) in general, particularly in any of the following areas:

1) Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for decision making in water systems 

2) Integrating in-situ and geophysical datasets for hydrogeology

3) Understanding climate disturbances impacts on water quality and quantity

4) Advanced hydrologic modeling: flow or reactive transport modeling

please feel free to reach out to me directly: lijing.wang AT uconn.edu, with your up-to-date CV and your research plan/goal. Premilinary contact is preferred before the application deadline (**January 10th, 2024**) so that we can learn if there is a good fit. Detailed information about the UConn Earth Sciences graduate program can be found [here](https://earthsciences.uconn.edu/graduateprogram/). 

Desired qualifications include:

- MS or BS degrees in earth sciences, hydrology, hydrogeology, environmental science, geology, geophysics, environmental engineering, climate science, data science, or other related fields.
- Experience in scientific programming (e.g., Python, Matlab, R, Julia).
- Experience in machine learning, hydrologic modeling (e.g., MODFLOW, ATS-Amanzi, ParFlow), Bayesian statistics (e.g., Bayes' Rule, Markov chain Monte Carlo), geostatistics, or field experiences in hydrology is highly desirable. 
- MS or BS degrees in earth sciences, hydrology, hydrogeology, environmental science, geology, geophysics, environmental engineering, climate science, data science or other related fields. 
- Have experience in scientific programming (i.e. Python/Matlab/R/Julia). 
- Highly desirable experience in machine learning, hydrologic modeling (i.e. MODFLOW/ATS-Amanzi/ParFlow),  Bayesian statistics (i.e. Bayes' Rule, Markov chain Monte Carlo), Geostatistics or field experiences in hydrology. 

However, technical skills are not required to join the group. Motivation and a willingness to learn are often the keys to success. 


### How to Apply

Graduate students in UConn Earth Sciences will receive funding through research and teaching assistantships. To be considered for full funding for admission in Fall 2024, please apply through the [UConn Graduate School Website](https://grad.uconn.edu/admissions/apply-to-uconn/) by clicking *Apply Now* before January 10th, 2024. We strongly encourage students from underrepresented groups in earth sciences to apply. 

Note that you might not be able to find me in the application system as your suggested advisor because I will join in Fall 2024. Don't worry, please put your interested advsior(s) in your personal assay and send me an email (lijing.wang AT uconn.edu) once you have submitted the application. Thank you! 

**Key Components**

1. The formal application form provided by the Graduate School, together with the application fee. In some circumstances, your application fee may be waived. Please refer to the UConn Graduate School [Fee Waiver Policy](https://grad.uconn.edu/admissions/application-fee-waivers/). 

2. Official transcripts from undergraduate and graduate institutions you have attended. 

3. Three letters of reference. 

4. Your personal essay (~2 pages). This may include your research interests, your previous achievement, your motivation for Ph.D. study, who you might want to work with. Here you can indicate your research interests and the potential advisors you would like to work with.
