Hi, I'm Lijing, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geological Sciences at Stanford University. I am affiliated with [Stanford Center of Earth Resource Forecasting](https://scerf.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Data Science Scholar Program](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program). 

My research focuses on **statistics and machine learning in geosciences**. I use computer vision methods with large geophysical and geological spatial datasets in earth resource explorations, especially groundwater, to build 3D stochastic subsurface models with geological realism. With these stochastic geomodels, I design Bayesian framework to perform uncertainty quantification on predictions, thereby facilitating the data-driven management of earth resources. **My vision is that new scalable machine learning algorithms can, and should, help addressing real-world sustainability problems**, such as unrecovered groundwater storage and agricultural pollutions.  

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Space Physics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University. During my bachelors, I worked on several applied statistics projects with social impacts on energy, environment, and health. These projects encouraged me to pursue the interdisciplinary field in between data science and earth science to facilitate the sustainable development of earth resources. In Summer 2020, I did a Research Data Scientist internship in Total E&P, collaborating with Google Cloud. We focus on Artificial Intelligence solutions to optimize geophysical data interpretation with sparse labels. 

I am passionate about teaching data science methods to geoscience audiences and the broader scientific community, with real earth science studies (i.e. natural hazards, climate change, earth resources) and interactive python notebooks!
