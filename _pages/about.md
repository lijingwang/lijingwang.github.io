Hi, I'm Lijing, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Geological Sciences at Stanford University, advised by Professor [Jef Caers](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jef-caers?tab=bio). I am affiliated with [Stanford Center of Earth Resource Forecasting](https://scerf.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Data Science Scholar Program](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program). I am also pursuing a Ph.D. minor in Computer Science. 

My research focuses on **bayesian inversion, geostatistics, and machine learning-assisted geomodeling**. I use computer vision methods with large geophysical and geological spatial datasets in earth resource explorations, especially in groundwater, to build 3D stochastic subsurface models with geological realism. I also design hierarchical Bayesian framework to perform uncertainty quantification with monitoring wells, thereby facilitating the data-driven management of earth resources. **My vision is that new scalable machine learning algorithms can, and should, help addressing real-world sustainable management problems**, such as unrecovered groundwater storage and understanding/remediating agricultural pollutions. 

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Space Physics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University. During my bachelors, I worked on several applied statistics projects with social impacts on environment, energy, and health. These projects encouraged me to pursue the interdisciplinary field in between data science and earth science to facilitate the sustainable development of earth resources. In Summer 2020, I did a Research Data Scientist internship in Total E&P, collaborating with Google Cloud. We focus on Artificial Intelligence solutions to optimize geophysical data interpretation with sparse labels. 

I am passionate about teaching data science methods to geoscience audiences and the broader scientific community, with real earth science studies (i.e. natural hazards, climate change, earth resources) and interactive python notebooks! We are developing a new textbook on **Data Science for the Geosciences**. Stay tuned! 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, photography, piano-playing, and I love all PLANTS.
