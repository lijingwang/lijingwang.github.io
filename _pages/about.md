I'm Lijing, currently a Postdoc Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, working in the [Watershed Function SFA](https://watershed.lbl.gov/). I will be joining the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. **I am looking for several motivated Ph.D. students to join our group at UConn starting in Fall 2024.** If you are interested in water, climate and artificial intelligence (AI) in general, particularly in any of the following areas:

1) Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for decision making in water systems 

2) Integrating in-situ and geophysical datasets for hydrogeology

3) Understanding climate disturbances impacts on water quality and quantity

4) Advanced hydrologic modeling: flow or reactive transport modeling

please feel free to reach out to me directly: lijing.wang AT uconn.edu, with your up-to-date CV and your research plan/goal. Stay tuned for the official recruiting announcement, which will be shared in Fall 2023. The detailed application process of the UConn Earth Sciences graduate program is [here](https://earthsciences.uconn.edu/graduateprogram/).


## More about me

I graduated from the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Stanford University in March 2023, advised by Professor [Jef Caers](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jef-caers?tab=bio). I also hold a Ph.D. minor in Computer Science. At Stanford, I was affiliated with [Stanford Center of Earth Resource Forecasting](https://scerf.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Data Science Scholar Program](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program). My ultimate career goal is to **provide decision solutions for water resources under climate change using advanced modeling, machine learning, and decision science methods**. Previous to the graduate school, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Space Physics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University. 

I have devoted my career to developing state-of-art data integration and model calibration methods specifically for water resource management. I first entered this field as an undergraduate working on spatial data integration using geostatistics in air pollution predictions. Geostatistics opened a new quantitative world for me to formulate spatial models for the earth systems. During my Ph.D., I worked with Professor Jef Caers at Stanford to advance geostatistics, Bayesian inference, and stochastic optimization methods to quantify the uncertainty of earth resources, with a primary interest in water resources. From contaminated sites to mountainous floodplains, my research development sheds light on how water exchanges spatiotemporally, what the driving factors are, and provides informed predictions for water resource management. 

I am passionate about teaching data science methods to geoscience audiences and the broader scientific community, with real earth science studies (i.e. natural hazards, climate change, earth resources) and interactive python notebooks! Our [new textbook: **Data Science for the Geosciences**](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/data-science-for-the-geosciences/64E10197819920B0B5F36472B3B872C4?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark) has been published (August 2023) with Cambridge University Press. We offer Python notebooks, lecture videos/slides, and homework assignments that are available to both students and instructors, making it easier to learn data science in geosciences with less statistics/programming background. Please check it out! 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, photography, piano-playing, and I love all plants.
