**Background**

Hello, I’m Amber, and I am an Undergraduate Researcher in the Earth Sciences Department. I’m a junior studying Environmental Engineering and an Alum from the EcoHouse Learning Community as a Floor Mentor and an Alum from the Office of Sustainability as a Sustainable Outreach Coordinator. I am interested in hydrology, hydrogeology, groundwater systems, and environmental modelling. I am a member of FFFU, Outing Club, Beekeeping Club, and the American Academy of Environmental Engineering and Sciences (AAEES). In my free time, I enjoy reading and crocheting.
