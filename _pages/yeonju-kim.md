**Background**

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Connecticut. I hold a B.S. and M.S. in Civil Engineering, with a concentration in hydrology and water resources management. My doctoral research focuses on the hydrological impacts of beaver dams in the New England region. In particular, I study groundwater-surface water interactions through a model-data integration approach, combining field observations with computational modeling. My work seeks to advance understanding of hydrological processes and their implications for sustainable water resources management.
